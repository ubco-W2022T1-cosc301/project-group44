### Question: 
As males and females age, what trends can be picked up in their medical expenses? At what point in their lives do they pay the highest?

### Visualizations

### Conclusion/Analysis:
To start, different individuals live very different lives which varies medical charges from person to person. This results in a plot with a lot of seemingly 'random' dots that point to each individual.

However, it is safe to conclude that as one ages, their medical expenses also increase, regardless of ones sex. 

With this, one noticeable difference is the consistency of the 'clumps' of people as the age goes up.

For males, there seems to be another consistent clump from around 15 thousand to 20 thousand and another smaller yet visible clump from 35 thousand to 45 thousand. 

For females, this appears more random as dots fluctuate the plot. These fluctations appear more commom in their 20s, then reduce in ther 30s and returns in their mid 40s onwards.

To conclude, there is no clear differences between medical expenses as people age within males and females. Together, medical expenses rise as people grow older. Males find themselves consistently paying higher charges that increase as they age; while females charges appears more random in the earlier ages, but then slowly pay at a steady rate.
