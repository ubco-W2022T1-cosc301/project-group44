## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The dataset we chose details the medical expenses of 1300 individuals in the United States. The subjects vary in age, gender, BMI, and location. From this, we'll be able to compare the average medical expenses and see if there is any correlation between these factors, such as age/BMI, expenses/smoking, and costs between children vs. adults. This data can be used to predicate an individual's medical expenses by comparing their attributes to the averages of similar groups. For example, the medical expenses of a middle-aged woman that smokes can be predicated by gathering the related data and averaging it. Furthermore, these conclusions can promote general health and financial well-being by preventing people from unfavourable lifestyles like smoking by showing them possible costs. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset has about 1300 rows, each corresponding to an individual. There are seven columns that specify the person's age, sex, BMI, if they have children and how many, if they are a smoker, the region they live in, and how much they were charged. This wide range of attributes will allow us to compare and contrast medical expenses between different lifestyles, ages, and sexes.
